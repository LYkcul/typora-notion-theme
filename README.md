# Notion for Typora
A faithful reproduction of the original Notion theme, available in both dark mode and light mode.

## Styles

The theme is available in two styles: `original` and `enhanced`. The original style features simpler quotations and tables, mimicking the Notion app. The enhanced style darkens quotation backgrounds and adds alternating colors to the table backgrounds, improving visibility.
